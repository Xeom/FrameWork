This project was created for educational use, specifically
teaching Python and the basic concepts of programming.

This was created as a replacement for teaching via "Scratch",
(http://scratch.mit.edu/), which while an excellent tool, that
I highly recommend, is not suitable for more advanced 
audiences.

You are free to do whatever you want with it really. You are
free to use and modify the source for use in any other project,
as long as whatever contribution my code made to that project
is acknowledged.
